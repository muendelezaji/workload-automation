    description = '''
    A workload to perform standard productivity tasks with Google Slides. The workload carries
    out various tasks, such as creating a new presentation, adding text, images, and shapes,
    as well as basic editing and playing a slideshow.

    Under normal circumstances, this workload should be able to run without a network connection.
    The workload is split into two main scenarios, each starting out with the common steps 1-3.

    --- load ---
    Copying a PowerPoint presentation on to the device to test slide navigation

    Test description:
    1. Starts the app in offline access mode, and skips the welcome screen.
    2. Opens the left-hand app drawer menu and closes it again to measure menu transitions.
    3. Goes to the app settings page and enables PowerPoint compatibility mode. This allows
       .PPT files to be created inside Google Slides.
    4. A navigation test is performed while the file is in editing mode, swiping forward to
       the next slide until the end.
    5. Thereafter, the same action is done in the reverse direction back to the first slide.
    6. Finally, one more forward navigation pass through is done while in presentation mode.

    --- create ---
    Creating a new file in the application and performs basic editing on it.

    Test description:
    1. Starts the app in offline access mode, and skips the welcome screen.
    2. Opens the left-hand app drawer menu and closes it again to measure menu transitions.
    3. Goes to the app settings page and enables PowerPoint compatibility mode. This allows
       .PPT files to be created inside Google Slides.
    4. Creates a new PowerPoint presentation in the app (PPT compatibility mode) with a title
       slide and saves it to device storage.
    5. Inserts another slide with a title and text content. The font size of the text is then
       reduced to fit the slide.
    6. Inserts a slide with a title and image content. The image is picked from the gallery.
    7. Inserts the last slide and adds a shape which is dragged and resized to fit the view.
       Some text is also entered in this final slide.
    8. Finally, the app is navigated to the documents list, closing the file in the process.
       The file is then deleted from the documents list and removed from the device.
